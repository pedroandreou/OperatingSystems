## Task:

- Modify 𝑘𝑖𝑟𝑘. 𝑐 (calling it 𝑘𝑖𝑟𝑘2. 𝑐) so that it is able to send 𝑡𝑤𝑜 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑓 messages: 
1. Urgent messages: consist of only capital letters as part of the message string
2. Regular messages: normal messages 

-  Modify 𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑐𝑘. 𝑐 (creating 𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑐𝑘2. 𝑐) to receive only normal messages
- Create a third program called ‘𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑓𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑡. 𝑐’ that only receives the urgent messages.



# Tips: 
1. Run the code of the three programs in separate command windows and check that they work accordingly
2. Use Beej's Guide
