## :dart: Tasks to accomplish  

1. Modify 𝑘𝑖𝑟𝑘. 𝑐 (calling it 𝑘𝑖𝑟𝑘2. 𝑐) so that it is able to send 𝑡𝑤𝑜 𝑡𝑦𝑝𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑓 messages:    
    - Urgent messages: consist of only capital letters as part of the message string  
    - Regular messages: normal messages   
    
2. Modify 𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑐𝑘. 𝑐 (creating 𝑠𝑝𝑜𝑐𝑘2. 𝑐) to receive only normal messages  
3. Create a third program called ‘𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑓𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑡. 𝑐’ that only receives the urgent messages.



## 🔑 Tips
1. Run the code of the three programs in separate command windows and check that they work accordingly
2. Use Beej's Guide
